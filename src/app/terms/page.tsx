            While availing the services of “Amar Seva Ghar”, you shall not use
            this service in any way for any purpose that is anti-state,

            Since "Amar Sheva Ghar" services are technology-dependent and
            technology has many limitations and errors, "Amar Sheva Ghar" will
            not be responsible for any problems encountered due to technical
            errors that cannot be easily resolved.

            “Amar Sheva Ghar” is a service-oriented platform. “Amar Sheva Ghar”
            connects the service recipient, the health card holder, and the
            service provider (hospital). So here are some terms and conditions
            for receiving the service:
          </li>
          <li className="md:pb-4 pb-2">
            The service recipient can verify all personal information about the
            hospital before receiving the service. Although “Amar Sheba Ghar”
            verifies the information of the service providers (hospitals) on its
            own responsibility and only after verifying the information, “Amar
            Sheba Ghar” allows them to provide services to them. But the service
            recipient can verify all the issues of the service providers
            (hospitals) if he wants. If any problem is encountered after
            verification by the service recipient, “Amar Sheba Ghar” will not be
            considered responsible.
          </li>
          <li className="md:pb-4 pb-2">
            Since "Amar Sheva Ghar" establishes a connection between the service
            recipient and the service provider, "Amar Sheva Ghar" has no direct
            connection with the provision of the service, so "Amar Sheva Ghar"
            will not be considered responsible if there is any problem in the
            provision of the service. However, if the service recipient
            encounters any problem due to the provision of the service, if he
            informs "Amar Sheva Ghar" support, appropriate action will be taken
            against the service provider subject to appropriate evidence.
          </li>
          <li className="md:pb-4 pb-2">
            "Amar Sevaghar" only connects the service recipient with the
            registered hospital. So here you can use the "Amar Sevaghar" medium
            to get hospital services and seek advice for your health problems.
          </li>
          <li className="md:pb-4 pb-2">
            You can use the services of "Amar Sheba Ghar" to receive services
            from registered hospitals, but "Amar Sheba Ghar" will not be
            responsible for any physical problems, limb loss, or loss of life
            caused by that service.

            To avail the services of "Amar Sevaghar", we must come to a
